The best way to get in contact with me is through the
[repository](https://github.com/polettix/teepee/) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). There you can e.g. open an
[issue](https://github.com/polettix/teepee/issues), or propose a [pull
request](https://github.com/polettix/teepee/pulls).


If you just need to write me, you can use either the twitter account you
can find at the bottom of the page, or head to [my
blog](http://blog.polettix.it/) and find more ways to communicate with
me. It shouldn't be that difficult.
